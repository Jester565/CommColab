What is CommNode::LinkQueue supposed to do?

Comms::InitConnection's address parameter is never used.

Should the queue in comms contain references or shared_ptrs?

NULL or nullptr?  Doesn't really matter but in the future which one would you prefer?

UDP::si_other is no longer used because of the UdpLink::map (map isn't a very good name for that by the way maybe name is clients instead).

UDP::rx_buf not being used, shouldn't need because buffer is being passed in as parameter in Recv.

Check the move constructor on UDP... its not transferring over slen and fd.

MAJOR ISSUE: UDP clients will close the socket upon destruction.

Shouldn't UDP be initialized to the socket being closed.
