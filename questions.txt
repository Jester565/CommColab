Do we have to support C++9 or can we go all C++11?

We need some way of specifying if a methods been overriden, like the override keyword in C++11.

Do we want a Copy() method in the AbstractPacket, or just the Create.

Whats the purpose of the typedef at the bottom of abstractpacket?

Whats the purpose of GetValue(AbstractPacket&) in abstractpacket... Can't we just cast it normally.  Also this function returns a reference, which I think is evil.

Is the packets.h file just an example?

Why is the CommThread constructor created a thread then using that thread to initialize the attribute thr in the constructor?
