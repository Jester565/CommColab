What is CommNode::LinkQueue supposed to do?

Should the queue in comms contain references or shared_ptrs?

NULL or nullptr?  Doesn't really matter but in the future which one would you prefer?

UDP::si_other is no longer used because of the UdpLink::map (map isn't a very good name for that by the way maybe name is clients instead).

UDP::rx_buf not being used, shouldn't need because buffer is being passed in as parameter in Recv.

Check the move constructor on UDP... its not transferring over slen and fd.

MAJOR ISSUE: UDP clients will close the socket upon destruction.

Shouldn't UDP be initialized with the socket status set to SOCKET_CLOSED?

Currently, passing NULL into the address will cause a runtime error.  And it makes sense to pass in NULL to the address because it doesn't do anything for two of the protocols...

It seems like encryption is enforced.  Perhaps it would be better to only enable encryption when LoadKey has been called.

The sendArray passed into Serial::send MUST be 4 bytes larger than the value of the length parameter. This could lead to undefined behavior and invalid CRC's.
