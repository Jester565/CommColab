C++ has functionallity to print the name of an objects type.  Let's see how to use it.

Doc Link:
http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/typeid

Warning:
1. Look at docs.  If there are no virtual methods in a base class and you inherit from the base class and try to call typeid on that object, it will print out the base class's name.

2. Make sure to dereference pointers when using this method.  If you don't dereference, polymorphism won't be taken into account.
